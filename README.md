# Numerocket 🚀📈

A 2D Flappy Bird clone with a **Numerai data-science tournament theme**. Built with vanilla HTML5, CSS, and the Canvas API — zero dependencies, deployable anywhere.

Navigate a pixel-art alligator with a rocket launcher through stock-chart obstacle bars set against a scrolling Tokyo cityscape. Each gap you clear scores `1 NMR ≈ $1`. Hit a bar or the ground and it's Game Over.

## Play

Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Spacebar** | Jump / Start |
| **Click** | Jump / Start |
| **Tap (mobile)** | Jump / Start |

- Menu shows your **ATH (All-Time High)** score above the title
- Game Over → Menu → Start (no instant restart)

## Visual Theme

- **Background:** Parallax-scrolling Tokyo cityscape at night with stock chart overlay (`background.jpg`, 1200×600)
- **Obstacles:** Candlestick-chart bars with two-tone green gradient (`#00e676` → `#009624`), mirrored direction so light side faces the gap, black border + wicks
- **Player:** Pixel-art alligator in hoodie with rocket launcher (`player.png`, 120×120 visual, 80×80 collision hitbox)
- **Effects:** Sci-fi exhaust smoke trail (radial-gradient particles), tier-coloured player glow disc, dual shockwave rings on level-up, Web Audio chiptune SFX, CRT scanline overlay, gentle screen shake on death
- **Typography:** Courier New monospace — terminal/data-science aesthetic
- **Display:** Auto-resizing canvas fills viewport height at 2:3 ratio, DPR-aware for Retina sharpness

## Customization

All gameplay constants are at the top of the `<script>` section in `index.html`:

| Constant | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `GRAVITY` | 0.5 | Falling speed (higher = faster fall) |
| `JUMP_VELOCITY` | -8 | Jump strength (negative = upward) |
| `GAP_SIZE_INITIAL_MIN` | 250 | Starting minimum gap between bars (random range) |
| `GAP_SIZE_INITIAL_MAX` | 270 | Starting maximum gap between bars |
| `GAP_SIZE_FLOOR_MIN` | 220 | Hard floor: smallest minimum gap (scales down with score) |
| `GAP_SIZE_FLOOR_MAX` | 240 | Hard floor: smallest maximum gap |
| `GAP_SCALE_INTERVAL` | 5 | Obstacles per gap-shrink step |
| `GAP_SCALE_STEP` | 2 | Pixels gap shrinks each interval |
| `MIN_GAP_DISTANCE` | 100 | Minimum vertical distance between consecutive gaps |
| `COLLISION_PADDING` (in `checkCollision`) | 8 | Collision fairness — higher = easier to dodge |
| `TIER_INTERVAL` | 10 | Score per difficulty tier promotion |
| `SPAWN_INTERVAL_MIN` | 90 | Minimum frames between obstacle spawns |
| `SPAWN_INTERVAL_MAX` | 120 | Maximum frames between obstacle spawns |

**Difficulty tiers:** Apprentice → Contributor → Researcher → Expert → Master → Grandmaster — each increases obstacle speed and changes player glow colour.

## Swapping Assets

Assets live in the `assets/` folder. Edit the source paths at the top of the game script:

```javascript
const PLAYER_IMAGE_SRC = 'assets/player.png';      // 120×120 RGBA PNG
const BACKGROUND_IMAGE_SRC = 'assets/background.jpg'; // wide panoramic, auto-scaled
const OBSTACLE_IMAGE_SRC = null;                     // set to replace candlestick bars
```

- **Player:** Auto-scaled from source dimensions, collision is always 80×80 centered in visual
- **Background:** Auto-detected dimensions, fills canvas height, scrolls at 30% of obstacle speed with seamless wrap

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "v0.5"
git push origin main
```

Then in your repo **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch → main, /root** and save. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/numerocket/`.
